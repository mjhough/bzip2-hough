# Matthew Hough's version of BZip2
My implementation of the BZip2 algorithm in C++ with a linearithmic time Burrows-Wheeler transform algorithm. Developed based on the notes I took on the BZip2 algorithm while studying CS240 at the University of Waterloo.

## Development progress

#### Encoding
- [x] Burrows-Wheeler transform
- [x] Move-to-front transform
- [x] Run-length encoding
- [x] Huffman encoding

#### Decoding
- [ ] Huffman encoding
- [ ] Run-length encoding
- [ ] Move-to-front transform
- [ ] Burrows-Wheeler transform

## Instructions
Run `make` to compile the program. Then run `./bzip2-hough` to run the program. It will ask you to input the string you want to run bzip2 on. When you do so and hit enter, you should see the output of each stage of the bzip2 algorithm.
