# bzip2-hough
My implementation of the BZip2 algorithm in C++. Developed based on the notes I took on the BZip2 algorithm while studying CS240 at the University of Waterloo.

## Development progress

#### Encoding
- [x] Burrows-Wheeler transform
- [ ] Move-to-front transform
- [ ] Run-length encoding
- [ ] Huffman encoding
